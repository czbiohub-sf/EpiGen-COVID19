## Highlights

- The number of missing infectious is an important parameter to estimate because it provides information about the scale of the epidemic, which in turn affects resource allocation. Also, it affects how controllable the epidemic is and for how long the epidemic will go on.
- Incidence or prevalence time series are generally the lower bound of the total number of infections due to under-reporting. Viral phylogenies provide can fill in this knowledge gap because viruses continue to evolve as they spread through asymptomatic human populations.

## Data

Genomic data came from GISAID. The time-scaled phylogeny came from [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/ncov).
